This is based on the CI server, Integrity with changes made to simplify
deployment.

This makes the following assumptions on your environment:
0) You are running Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
1) You don't have Ruby installed
2) You have Git installed
3) You don't have nginx installed
4) You don't have mysql installed
5) The home directory for the server is:
	/home/integrity/ and the software is located at
	/home/integrity/integrity
	NOTE: Edit: install/thin.yml and clean.rb to change these settings.



This software will:
1) Install ruby and the related libraries (including build-essential)
2) Install the rubygems-update package through `gem'
3) Install all the packages required by Integrity to run and install
4) Install nginx as a reverse proxy
5) Configure nginx to start on boot
	You can change nginx configuration options in install/nginx_site_integrity
6) Configure the Ruby server Thin to run 2 servers at boot
	You can change these configuration options in install/thin.yml
7) Install mysql-server-5.1
