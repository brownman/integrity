This is based on the CI server, Integrity with changes made to simplify
deployment.

This makes the following assumptions on your environment:
0) You are running Ubuntu 10.04 LTS on Amazon
1) You don't have Ruby installed
2) You have Git installed
3) The home directory for the server is:
	/home/integrity/
4) The software is located in /home/integrity/integrity


This software will:
1) Install ruby and the related libraries (including build-essential)
2) Install the rubygems-update package through `gem'
3) Install all the packages required by Integrity to run and install
4) Install nginx as a reverse proxy
5) Configure nginx to start on boot
6) Configure the Ruby server Thin to run 2 servers at boot
